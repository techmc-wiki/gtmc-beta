# GTMC Website Design System

This document records the visual system actually in use on the GTMC website. It is descriptive, not prescriptive: when reality and this doc disagree, the code wins. Source-of-truth examples live in `app/globals.css`, `components/ui/*`, `components/layout/*`, and the homepage and article-reader compositions.

## Design Direction

The site uses a **"Print Edition"** aesthetic: an academic monograph series
(think Springer *Graduate Texts in Mathematics*) re-set for the web, layered
over the original technical-drafting bones.

The conceit: GTMC is a textbook series, so the site looks like one. Archival
paper, navy-black ink, a single unmistakable **Springer-yellow signal band**,
serif display titles, and mono "apparatus" text (folios, running heads,
colophons) where a book would have typographic furniture.

- Warm paper surfaces (`tech-bg` is cream, not blue-white) with flat,
  near-square geometry. No rounded corners.
- Serif display type (`display-title` / STIX Two Text + Noto Serif SC) for
  page titles, section titles, and article headings. Ink-dark, tight tracking,
  sentence case — never uppercase serif.
- Monospace remains the "apparatus" voice: nav links, labels, status readouts,
  folios, build stamps. Uppercase + wide tracking belongs to mono only.
- `tech-signal` (Springer yellow) is the one loud color. Used in hairline
  accents (the 3px nav band, header rules, active-state underlines, the logo
  mark) — never as a large fill except the hero book band.
- Drafting motifs survive in supporting roles: dimension marks, guide lines,
  corner brackets on technical panels, dot-grid backdrop.
- Motion still reads like instrumentation: fade, clip-path slide, pop-in,
  sweep, scan confirm.

Avoid generic SaaS gradients, pill cards, emoji-as-icons, heavy drop shadows,
purple-on-white "AI default" palettes, and ad-hoc hex colors when a `tech-*`
token will do. Avoid uppercase serif and letter-spaced serif: the serif voice
is calm; the mono voice is technical.

## UX Principles

The visual system serves a reading experience. These principles govern how
users move through the site and how affordances are surfaced.

### The site is a book, not an app

GTMC is a community textbook. Every surface should reinforce the book
metaphor, not fight it.

- **The homepage is the book opening.** A cover (hero) scrolls into a real
  printed Table of Contents built from the live article tree — chapter
  numbers, dotted leaders, section counts, appendix separator. The TOC is
  the primary navigation, not a secondary index page.
- **Reading progress is a bookmark, not a progress bar.** Articles record a
  localStorage bookmark (slug, title, scroll position). The homepage shows
  a bookmark ribbon — title, yellow progress bar, one-click return — like a
  physical bookmark tucked into the book.
- **The reader has a running head.** Articles inside a chapter show a
  yellow `CH 01` chip and linked chapter title above the article metadata,
  so a reader arriving from search always knows where they are in the book.
- **Glossary is the index.** The command palette (`⌘K`) returns an
  `INDEX — GLOSSARY` section alongside article results. Cross-linking
  between articles and glossary terms is a first-class concern.

### Navigation respects audience

The site has three audiences: readers, contributors, and admins. The nav
must not lie about what's available.

- **Anonymous visitors see reader-only nav**: Articles, Glossary, Feedback.
  No dead-end links to pages that require login.
- **MY DRAFTS appears only for authenticated users** — after Glossary,
  before Feedback. It's a contributor affordance, not a reader one.
- **REVIEW HUB appears only for admins**, injected by `AuthAwareNav` after
  a session check.
- **FEEDBACK** (formerly FEATURES) describes what the page actually is:
  bug reports and feature requests. The old label "FEATURES" implied a
  feature list, not an issue tracker.

### Reader surfaces speak the book's language

Labels on reading surfaces use textbook vocabulary, not drafting jargon.

- Chapter tree panel: **Table of Contents** (not `SYS.DIR_TREE`).
- Search modal header: **Search the Text** (not `SYS.QUERY_ENGINE`).
- Outline rail: **On This Page** (not `Paragraph Outline`).
- All reader-surface labels are localized — no hardcoded English on
  Chinese pages, no hardcoded Chinese on English pages.

### Footer is a reader/contributor map

The footer is organized by audience intent: READ (Preface, Articles,
Glossary), COMMUNITY (Contribute, Team, Issues), SOURCE (Errata &
Feedback, Repository, License), DOWNLOAD (Offline PDF). Section headers
are localized.

## Color Tokens

The Tailwind v4 theme is defined in `app/globals.css` (`@theme`). There is no `tailwind.config.*`. Use these tokens; avoid raw hex values.

| Token             | Hex       | Role                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tech-bg`         | `#f5f4ef` | Warm archival-paper page background                        |
| `tech-main`       | `#4a5468` | Ink-gray for body text, borders, controls, labels          |
| `tech-main-dark`  | `#20283c` | Navy-black ink: headings and high-emphasis text            |
| `tech-accent`     | `#c9cfdd` | Hover fills, subtle highlights, selected states            |
| `tech-line`       | `#d6d3c8` | Border-only token: dot grid and quiet dividers             |
| `tech-signal`     | `#e3b505` | Springer yellow: hairline accents, active states, the mark |
| `tech-signal-ink` | `#20283c` | Text color guaranteed legible on a `tech-signal` fill      |

Usage rules
- Default text: `text-tech-main`. High-emphasis titles: `text-tech-main-dark`.
- Common borders: `border-tech-main/40`. Quiet guide lines: `guide-line` or `border-tech-main/20`. Strong structural rules (page header, footer top, nav band) use `border-tech-main-dark` with a short `bg-tech-signal` tick overlapping them.
- Surfaces: `bg-surface/70`–`/95` plus `backdrop-blur-sm` (or `backdrop-blur-md` on hero/modal panels). Pale fills use `bg-tech-bg/50`–`/80`. Never raw `bg-white`.
- `tech-signal` budget: at most one band + a few hairline ticks per screen. It marks "you are here" (active nav, current chapter, focus rules) and brand moments (logo mark, hero band). It is never body text on light backgrounds and never a large fill outside the hero.
- Filled controls invert to ink: `bg-tech-main-dark text-tech-bg` (e.g. primary buttons, active language tab). Primary button hover flips to `bg-tech-signal text-tech-signal-ink`.
- Hover/selection stay muted: `bg-tech-accent/10`, `bg-tech-main/5`–`/10`, `hover:border-tech-main/60`.
- Semantic colors are translucent and bracketed: yellow/blue/green/red at `/10` fills with `/40` borders. Neutral states (loading, secondary metadata) may use gray/slate/zinc at low opacity.
- `tech-line` is for borders only; it has no fill or text utility in practice.

## Theming

### Semantic surface tokens

Map every background, border, and text color to a semantic Tailwind token so both themes resolve through CSS variables.

| Tailwind class | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-tech-bg` | #f5f4ef | #14120d |
| `bg-surface` | #fcfbf8 | #1c1912 |
| `bg-surface-overlay` | #fcfbf8 | #221f16 |
| `bg-surface-input` | #fffefb | #121009 |
| `bg-surface-modal` | #fcfbf8 | #201d15 |
| `text-tech-main` | #4a5468 | #a8a290 |
| `text-tech-main-dark` | #20283c | #ece6d6 |
| `border-tech-line` | #d6d3c8 | #2d2a21 |
| `text-tech-advanced` | #8c2f39 | #c25664 |
| `bg-tech-accent` | #c9cfdd | #3d3a2f |
| `bg-tech-signal` | #e3b505 | #e9c531 |
| `text-tech-signal-ink` | #20283c | #14120d |

Dark mode is "Night Print": the same paper book under a warm lamp — dark
umber paper, cream ink, slightly brighter yellow. It is deliberately *not*
a blue-dark theme.

### Dark variant conventions

- Use `dark:` Tailwind variant, scoped via `[data-theme="dark"]`.
- Never use `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` in application code — the runtime `data-theme` attribute is the single source of truth.
- Replace hardcoded `bg-white` with `bg-surface` or `bg-surface-overlay`.
- Replace `text-slate-700` with `text-tech-main`, `text-slate-800/900` with `text-tech-main-dark`.

### Three.js background

Schematic viewer passes theme-aware background color to Three.js `renderer.setClearColor()`. Light: `#f5f4ef`, dark: `#14120d`.

### Icon recoloring

Icons use `currentColor` or `text-tech-main`. When contained in a `dark:` block that changes text color, icons follow automatically.

### Color-scheme CSS property

`color-scheme: light` is set on `:root`; `color-scheme: dark` is set on `[data-theme="dark"]`. This controls native browser elements (scrollbars, form controls, system dialogs).

## Typography

Fonts are declared in `app/globals.css` and loaded via `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.

Families
- Sans (body): `var(--font-geist-sans)`, `Noto Sans SC`, `PingFang SC`, `Microsoft YaHei`, `sans-serif`.
- Serif (display): `var(--font-stix-two-text)`, `Noto Serif SC`, `Songti SC`, `Georgia`, `serif` — exposed as `--font-serif` and the `display-title` utility.
- Mono (apparatus): `var(--font-geist-mono)`, `SF Mono`, `Consolas`, `Noto Sans Mono SC`, `monospace`.

Three voices
1. **Serif** speaks as the book: page titles, section titles, article headings, the logo wordmark, the hero. `display-title` = serif, semibold, `-0.015em` tracking, sentence case.
2. **Sans** speaks as the text block: body copy, descriptions, UI prose.
3. **Mono** speaks as the apparatus: nav, labels, badges, folios, status strips. Mono owns uppercase and wide tracking.

Scale
- Root font size scales by viewport: `16px` on small screens, stepping up to `18px` on large screens via media queries in `html`.
- Page titles: `display-title text-3xl md:text-5xl tracking-tight text-tech-main-dark`, with a mono kicker label above (`text-[0.625rem] tracking-[0.25em] uppercase text-tech-main/60`).
- Section titles: `display-title text-xl md:text-2xl` with a leading `size-2 bg-tech-signal` square and a bottom guide line (see `SectionTitle`).
- HUD and metadata labels: `font-mono text-xs tracking-widest uppercase text-tech-main/50`.
- Body copy: `text-sm/relaxed` to `text-base/relaxed`.
- Article paragraphs: `font-sans text-base/relaxed text-tech-main-dark`.
- Article headings (H1–H3): `markdown-title`, regular capitalization, semibold. `--font-markdown-title` resolves to the serif stack; H1 carries a heavy ink bottom rule, H3 a `tech-signal` left rule.

Tracking
- House default: `tracking-widest` (broadly used on labels, badges, nav).
- Custom step: `tracking-tech-wide` (`0.2em`) for slightly tighter HUD text.

## Layout and Spacing

Mobile-first, modest spacing, predictable container rhythm.

- Page container: `page-container` = `mx-auto max-w-6xl space-y-8`. The `-pb` variant adds `pb-12`.
- Site chrome max-width inside the nav strip: `max-w-450` (a custom Tailwind v4 spacing alias).
- Common gutters: `p-4 sm:p-6`, `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`. Editor and reader pages may go wider (`max-w-[1400px]`, `lg:px-24`).
- Common grids: `grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`.
- Page headers commonly stack on mobile and align on desktop: `flex flex-col gap-* md:flex-row md:items-end`.
- Touch targets meet `touch-target` (≥ `44px`) on buttons and primary controls.

12-column grid (asymmetric layouts)

Use this grid only when the page has asymmetric column allocations (sidebars, rails). Single-column pages use `page-container` instead.

- Container: `flex flex-col md:grid md:grid-cols-12 md:gap-6 md:max-w-360 md:mx-auto`. Mobile stacks vertically; grid activates at `md` (≥768px).
- Column allocation (default 3 | 7 | 2 split):
  - Left sidebar / nav: `md:col-span-3`
  - Main content: `md:col-span-7`, further capped at `max-w-3xl`
  - Right rail (TOC, related): `md:col-span-2`
- Variant: the footer uses a 4 | 8 split (`md:col-span-4` / `md:col-span-8`) with `md:gap-10` instead of `md:gap-6`.
- Current usages: article reader (`articles-layout-client.tsx`) and footer (`footer.tsx`).

## Navigation

Path: `components/layout/{site-shell,desktop-nav,mobile-nav,auth-aware-nav,auth-island,language-switcher}.tsx`.

Site shell
- `SiteShell` is the canonical frame: a sticky translucent top nav (`sticky top-0 z-50 border-b bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm`) over a full-width `main`.
- The footer is global but suppressed on `/` and on routes that call `HideFooter()`.

Desktop
- Hidden below `md`. Links are mono uppercase: `font-mono text-xs tracking-[0.15em] border-b-2 pb-1`.
- Active: `border-tech-signal text-tech-main`. Inactive: transparent border + `text-tech-main-dark`, hover swaps both to `tech-main`.
- Base nav is reader-only: Articles, Glossary, Feedback. MY DRAFTS is
  injected by `AuthAwareNav` for authenticated users (after Glossary).
  REVIEW HUB is injected for admins (before Feedback).

Mobile
- Hamburger button uses three `h-0.5 w-5 bg-tech-main` bars with animated transform states; touch target `min-h-11 min-w-11`.
- Drawer is portal-mounted under the top nav: `border-b border-tech-main/40 bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-md`, `duration-300` max-height transition.
- Drawer links are square bordered blocks with mono tracking and a hover fill.

Auth island and language switcher
- Unauthenticated users see a square `IN` login button. Authenticated users see an avatar with a hover dropdown to profile and sign-out.
- Language switcher is a 2-button segmented control (`Eng` / `中文`), square, monospace, locale-aware article-slug fallback.

## Surfaces

There is no single universal card. Several surface systems coexist; each is internally consistent.

`TechCard` (`components/ui/tech-card.tsx`)
- The default framed panel for feature, draft, review, and dashboard surfaces.
- Real props include: `tone`, `borderOpacity`, `background`, `padding`, `hover`, `brackets`, `bracketVariant`, `pattern` (`grid` only — `dots` is defined but unused).
- Conventions: thin `border-tech-main/40` borders, near-square geometry, optional `CornerBrackets`, hover changes border/fill opacity rather than adding elevation.

Editor surfaces (`components/editor/editor-surface.tsx`)
- A separate frame system used by the draft editor.
- Two visible variants: `default` (white/80 panel) and `grid` (grid-paper texture with inset shadow and corner ticks).
- Pairs with `EditorToolbarShell`, `EditorTabStrip`, `EditorTextarea` (CodeMirror), and `EditorPreviewFrame`.

Article reader shell
- A bordered translucent sheet around the entire reader: `border border-tech-main/40 bg-transparent p-6 sm:p-8` with corner brackets. This is its own surface, not a `TechCard`.

Profile and admin panels
- Custom panels with `border-tech-main/40 bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-md` and corner ticks. Used in profile and admin where `TechCard`’s API is too tight.

Selectable cards and segmented controls
- `SelectableCard` and `SegmentedControl` provide consistent radio-group / tab-group behavior with the same square, bordered, mono-label language.

Geometry guidance
- Default to square (`rounded-none`). Small radii are acceptable on dense indicators and skeletons (`rounded-sm`, `rounded-xs`, `rounded-[2px]`) and on circular dots (`rounded-full`). Reach for radii consciously, not by default.

## Buttons

`TechButton` is the primary control.

- Square geometry, border, bold mono uppercase text, wide tracking, `duration-300` transitions.
- Variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `danger`, `ghost`. Sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg` (md/lg meet touch minimums).
- Non-ghost buttons include a small accent corner mark.
- Two hover rhythms exist on the site:
  - Color/fill change (default): `hover:bg-tech-main hover:text-white transition-colors`.
  - Scale transform (heroes, error pages, key CTAs): `hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-95 transition-transform duration-300`.
- Avoid pill or fully-rounded CTAs unless a future design decision changes the system.

## Form Fields

`InputBox` and `TextAreaBox` are the canonical fields.

- Base: `border border-tech-main/30 bg-white/50 font-mono text-tech-main-dark`, square geometry, comfortable padding (`px-3 py-2.5 sm:px-4 sm:py-3`), min height `44px`.
- Focus is a deliberate border-color change (`focus:border-tech-main`) — fields do not use ring/outline.
- Error: red border and helper text, same square geometry.
- Provide visible labels and helper text near fields; placeholder-only labeling is not enough.
- Composition: form labels often live in a `FormField` with a left border accent and mono uppercase label.

## Status, Badges, Tags

Bracketed and translucent. Examples: `[Pending]`, `[Resolved]`, `[Closed]`.

- Base: `border px-2 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs tracking-wider`.
- Pending: yellow border/text on yellow `/10` fill.
- In progress / review: blue border/text on blue `/10` fill.
- Resolved / success: green border/text on green `/10` fill.
- Rejected / closed / destructive: red border/text on red `/10` fill.
- Neutral / loading: gray or slate at low opacity.
- Tags use `guide-line`, `bg-tech-main/5`, mono uppercase text, square borders.
- Pulsing status dots: `size-1.5 animate-pulse rounded-full bg-tech-main` for live indicators; reserve for state that actually updates.

## Decorative Motifs

Decoration should read as drafting overlay or instrumentation, not ornament.

Cross-verified motifs
- `CornerBrackets` (`components/ui/corner-brackets.tsx`) at `size-2`–`size-3`. Common variants: static frame, hover reveal, hover-only on `TechCard`, hover-expand on `TechCard`, diagonal pairs, top-bottom pairs.
- Thin guide lines: `guide-line`, `border-tech-main/20`, `section-divider`.
- Small square markers: `size-3 border border-tech-main/40 bg-tech-main/20`.
- Dot-grid backdrop on the body via a radial gradient using `tech-line` (mobile fixes grid size to `40px 40px`).
- Grid-paper texture on `EditorSurface variant="grid"` and `TechCard pattern="grid"`.
- Watermark + HUD label families on full-screen routes (auth, errors, homepage layers). Use them as a family, not as literal strings.
- Code/HUD readouts, hex dumps, isometric or radar diagrams, dimension marks (`|< ---- 640px ---- >|`).

Use `decor-desktop-only` to hide complex decoration on small screens.

Avoid
- One-off vignettes or radial glows unless they belong to a recurring surface system.
- Heavy drop shadows, conic gradients, or dense decorative SVG that does not appear elsewhere.
- Ornamental hover effects on elements that are not interactive.

## Motion

Motion lives in two distinct places.

CSS animation tokens (defined in `app/globals.css`, used across the site)

| Class                                 | Use                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `animate-fade-in`                     | Simple appearance                         |
| `animate-slide-up-fade`               | Section/CTA entrance                      |
| `animate-tech-pop-in`                 | Primary panel entrance with scale + blur  |
| `animate-tech-slide-in`               | Heading or line reveal with clip-path     |
| `animate-tree-drop-in`                | Tree/sidebar/outline reveal               |
| `animate-blueprint-sweep` / `shimmer` | Scan/sweep highlight on loading or CTAs   |
| `animate-target-blink`                | Anchor-target confirmation                |
| `animate-scan-confirm`                | Loading → content handoff                 |
| `animate-skeleton-exit`               | Skeleton → content fade with translate    |

Homepage parallax (`app/[locale]/_homepage/*`)
- The only place that imports `motion/react`. Drives a single bespoke parallax/tilt/blur system built on `useMotionValue`, `useSpring`, and `useTransform`.
- Spring physics only (`damping`, `stiffness`); no shared duration/easing tokens.
- Honors reduced motion and mobile gating inside `use-homepage-motion.ts`.

Rules
- Prefer `transform`, `opacity`, and `clip-path`; avoid layout-shifting animation.
- Stagger entrances with `[animation-delay:*]` for hero and lists.
- Decorative motion must be optional: pair `animate-*` with `motion-reduce:animate-none` (or `motion-reduce:animate-fade-out`) wherever the animation is nontrivial. The loading and skeleton primitives in `components/ui/loading-shell-primitives.tsx` are the working reference.
- Pulsing dots are reserved for live or status indicators.

## Backgrounds and Overlays

- Body background is a radial dot grid using `tech-line`, with responsive grid sizing.
- Panels use `bg-white/60`–`/95` plus `backdrop-blur-sm` or `backdrop-blur-md`.
- Mobile drawers and full-screen overlays use a translucent dark scrim: `bg-tech-main-dark/20 backdrop-blur-xs` (or similar).
- Empty states may layer dashed borders over a low-opacity diagonal stripe background.
- Localized scanline / striped overlays exist (empty states, chapter nav panel, draft editor backdrop). Implementation is intentionally ad hoc; treat them as a vocabulary, not a single utility.

## Article Reader

The reader is its own layout, separate from the rest of the site chrome.

- Outer frame: bordered translucent sheet with corner brackets, large gutters.
- Desktop layout (3 columns):
  - Left chapter nav (`w-64 lg:w-80`), sticky, internally scrollable.
  - Center column: `md:max-w-2xl` (or `md:max-w-3xl` when nav hidden), `1920:max-w-4xl` on very wide screens.
  - Right outline rail: hidden until `sm`, `sticky`, `w-16` expanding to `w-52` on hover.
- Mobile layout: chapter nav becomes a top toggle + collapsible sheet, the outline rail becomes a bottom progress bar (`MobileOutlineBar`).
- Markdown is rendered with custom components in `lib/markdown/components/*`. The Tailwind typography plugin is not used; do not introduce `prose-*` classes.
- Code blocks use a custom chrome (language strip, line counts, wrap toggle, copy button) and a bordered light frame.
- Prev/next article navigation is a 2-column grid on `md`+, with `min-h-[44px]` touch targets.

### Reading as a set page

The text block is typeset like a printed monograph, not a blog post.

- **Series imprint, not a stream readout.** The metadata head strip opens with the series name (`Graduate Texts in Minecraft`) behind a yellow signal tick, in mono small-caps — it reads as a running imprint. `PATH:` stays as honest apparatus on the right.
- **The opening paragraph carries a raised versal.** The first letter after the article H1 is set large in the serif title face. It is *raised* (sits on the baseline), not a sunk/floated drop cap — many articles open with a one-line intro, and a floated cap would collide with the block beneath. The incipit (first line) is set in small-caps. CJK openings keep the versal but opt out of small-caps, which has no meaning for Han characters.
- **Body paragraphs are justified at reading width.** At `md`+, top-level article paragraphs justify with `hyphens: auto`; mobile stays ragged-right where a narrow measure justifies poorly. Lists, blockquotes, and callouts are not justified.
- **Thematic breaks are asterisms.** A `---` in source renders as a centered hairline-rule + ink diamond device, not a full-width line.
- **Each article closes with a chapter-end mark.** A centered colophon device (three diamonds, the middle one in the article's accent — yellow, or burgundy when Advanced) sits between the body and the prev/next navigation, the way a printed chapter ends before the next begins.

## Loading

A coherent loading language exists; reach for it before inventing new spinners.

- `LoadingIndicator`: a pulsing `size-2` square dot with a mono uppercase label. The canonical inline loading treatment.
- `loading-shell-primitives.tsx` exposes `SegmentedBar`, `SweepOverlay`, `ScanConfirmOverlay`, and `SkeletonExitWrapper`. Route-level loading states use `SkeletonExitWrapper` with `aria-busy="true"` and an `aria-label`.
- `OperationProgress` provides a longer-running shell with `role="status" aria-live="polite"` and a `role="progressbar"` track.
- Mark async action buttons with `aria-busy` while pending; the system relies on this consistently.

## Interaction States

The system has clear conventions; apply them when writing or reviewing UI.

Focus
- Canonical: `focus-visible:outline-tech-main focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2`. Use this for buttons, cards, segmented options, and nav links.
- Inputs are a deliberate exception: focus is a border-color change to `border-tech-main`, no outline or ring.
- Never set `focus:outline-none` without supplying a visible replacement.

Hover
- Default rhythm: color/fill change with `transition-colors` and `duration-200`–`duration-300`.
- CTA rhythm: scale transform — `hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-95 transition-transform duration-300`. Reserve this for hero and primary call-to-action surfaces.

Active and disabled
- `active:scale-95` (or `[0.98]`) is the system pressed-state for the scale rhythm.
- Disabled controls dim with `opacity-50`–`opacity-60` and `cursor-not-allowed` (the latter is also handled globally in `app/globals.css`). Use `aria-busy` for in-flight async, `disabled`/`aria-disabled` for actually-blocked controls.

## Accessibility

The system reliably provides
- `aria-label` on icon-only controls (hamburger, search, language, close).
- `aria-busy` on async action buttons.
- `aria-live="polite"` on loading and status regions.
- `aria-expanded` on toggles (mobile nav, chapter tree, license, popovers).
- `role="status"` and `role="progressbar"` on `OperationProgress`.
- `motion-reduce:` fallbacks on the loading and skeleton primitives.
- A canonical focus-visible outline (see above).

Open gaps to be careful with when adding new UI
- Dialog/sheet focus trap and `aria-modal` are not provided centrally; supply them per-component.
- `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby` on dialogs/popovers are not consistent — set them when introducing a new overlay.
- Decorative `motion-*` animations outside the loading system do not have `motion-reduce:` fallbacks; add them when you reach for a new animation.

General rules
- Never disable zoom; preserve `viewport-fit=cover` and `initial-scale=1` from the root layout.
- Maintain ≥ `44px` touch targets on buttons, nav controls, and important links.
- Do not rely on hover-only affordances. Hover brackets and decorative reveals are decoration; clickable elements still need visible borders, labels, or icons.
- Mark purely decorative elements `pointer-events-none` and, where appropriate, `aria-hidden`.
- Hide dense technical decoration on mobile if it competes with content.
- Maintain readable contrast against translucent surfaces; body copy should not depend on full opacity.

## Implementation Checklist

Before adding or changing UI, check:

- [ ] Uses `tech-*` tokens instead of raw hex.
- [ ] Defaults to square geometry; reaches for radius consciously.
- [ ] Uses existing primitives (`TechCard`, `TechButton`, `InputBox`, `TextAreaBox`, `SelectableCard`, `SegmentedControl`, `CornerBrackets`, `PageHeader`, `SectionTitle`, `StatusBadge`, `StatusDot`) before inventing new ones.
- [ ] Picks the right surface system: `TechCard` for general panels, `EditorSurface` for editor work, the article shell for reader work, custom panels only when none of the above fit.
- [ ] Respects mobile-first layout and `44px` touch targets.
- [ ] Uses mono labels and HUD text intentionally, not for long prose.
- [ ] Keeps decorative HUD/grid/scan motifs subordinate to content.
- [ ] Uses motion from the existing `animate-*` catalog and avoids layout shift.
- [ ] Supplies a visible focus state — outline for controls, border-color for inputs.
- [ ] Pairs nontrivial decorative motion with a `motion-reduce:` fallback.
- [ ] Avoids emoji as structural icons; uses text, CSS geometry, or SVG instead.
